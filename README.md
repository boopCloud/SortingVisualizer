# SortingVisualizer

This repository contains popular sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Selection Sort etc.
The project has been developed with Python's Tkinter desktop GUI package.
The file named "SortAlgorithm.py" contains the logic behind the mentioned algorithms.
The file named "sortingAlgos.py" contains the GUI programming.
The file named "SortingVisualizer.exe" is the final executable file.
To run the ".exe" file locally, it is advised to download the ".exe" file along with the "SortAlgorithm.py" file as the executable file is dependent on it.
Once downloaded, put both the file in the same directory and run the ".exe" file.
You may also clone the repository.

NOTE: 
The mainloop() runs on a single thread so you may face a freezing issue in the app. You don't have to close the app as the thread is still running in the background. Once finished, you will see the output.
For better visualization, it is advised to select all the fields in the app, start the visualization and do not intefere the running thread.

P.S.
The above issue may get fixed in future commits.
